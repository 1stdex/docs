At the time of writing, the minimum requirement to act as a market maker on 1st is \$100,000 in USDC liquidity.

1st supplies the market maker with a mirror token loan equivalent to the provided USDC amount. This allows the market maker to quote liquidity on both sides of the trading pair from launch.

Liquidity requirements may change over time as markets evolve.
