Market makers on 1st earn revenue from the bid–ask spread on mirror token markets.

For each listed market, the maximum allowed spread is **0.5%**. Market makers quote buy and sell prices within this range and earn the difference between executed buy and sell prices as their primary source of revenue.

Spread revenue is realized through normal trading activity as orders execute against the market maker’s quotes.

This revenue compensates market makers for providing continuous liquidity, maintaining inventory, and operating within the required market parameters.
