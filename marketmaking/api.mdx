Market makers on 1st interact with the exchange through a dedicated market making API.

The API provides programmatic access to:

- Order placement and cancellation
- Order book data
- Trade execution and fills
- Account and position information

All market making on 1st is expected to be conducted through this API.

### **Market making API documentation**

Full technical documentation, including endpoints, authentication, and examples, is available here:

Market makers should review the API documentation before onboarding and integrate according to the requirements defined in the market making agreement.
