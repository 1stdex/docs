## LEGAL TERMS

### **PHYSICAL SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENT**

This commitment requires **mandatory physical delivery** of specified commodity tokens. **No cash settlement, offset, netting, derivatives, or alternative performance is permitted.** Obligation is satisfied only upon complete delivery of all committed tokens to the specified blockchain address.

### **COMMODITY FORWARD NATURE**

This agreement constitutes a **commodity forward contract** under U.S. law for future delivery of digital commodities, explicitly structured to comply with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and avoid classification as a security, futures, derivative, or financial instrument.

### NO SECURITY OR INVESTMENT CONTRACT

Tokens under this agreement are explicitly digital commodities intended for consumptive use within a blockchain network. Tokens confer no equity, voting rights, dividends, profit-sharing, or any financial returns or expectations.

### **ENFORCEABILITY**

This commitment is legally binding and enforceable by any current holder of MirrorToken tokens issued in connection with this Token Delivery Commitment. MirrorToken token holders may pursue specific performance, cover damages, and all other legal and equitable remedies for any failure to deliver tokens as committed.

### **NO ASSIGNMENT WITHOUT CONSENT**

I may not assign or delegate this delivery obligation without the prior written consent of GTFO DAO LLC and approval by MirrorToken token holders through established governance procedures.

### **DELIVERY CONFIRMATION**

Each delivery shall be deemed complete upon blockchain confirmation with the required number of block confirmations. I shall bear all transaction fees and costs associated with token delivery.

## REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

I represent and warrant that:

1. I have full legal and beneficial ownership of all committed tokens, free and clear of liens, encumbrances, and restrictions;
2. All committed tokens will be freely transferable upon delivery without restriction or additional requirements;
3. I have full corporate power and authority to make this binding commitment;
4. This commitment does not violate any agreement, court order, or legal obligation binding upon me;
5. The underlying token allocation rights are valid, enforceable, and in good standing;
6. I will not create, permit, or suffer any lien, encumbrance, or restriction on the committed tokens prior to delivery.

## DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

### **DEFAULT EVENTS**

I shall be in default under this commitment if:

- I fail to deliver any scheduled token quantity within three (3) business days after the specified delivery date;
- I deliver tokens that do not conform to the specifications set forth herein;
- Any representation or warranty proves to be materially false or misleading;
- I become insolvent, file for bankruptcy, or make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.

### **REMEDIES FOR DEFAULT**

Upon my default, MirrorToken token holders (acting individually or collectively) may pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies, including without limitation:

- Specific performance of this delivery commitment;
- Cover purchases of replacement tokens at my expense;
- Direct and consequential damages;
- Legal fees and costs incurred in enforcement.

MirrorToken token holders explicitly reserve the right to seek specific performance as the primary remedy, as monetary damages alone would be inadequate to compensate for commodity delivery failures.

## GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

### **GOVERNING LAW**

This Token Delivery Commitment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [GOVERNING_LAW_JURISDICTION], without regard to conflict of law principles.

### **DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

Any dispute arising out of or relating to this commitment shall be resolved through binding arbitration under the rules of [ARBITRATION_INSTITUTION]. Arbitration proceedings shall be:

- Conducted by a single arbitrator in [ARBITRATION_LOCATION]
- Conducted in English
- Subject to expedited procedures for disputes under \$1,000,000
- Enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

### **VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT**

I acknowledge that I am making this commitment voluntarily, with full understanding of my obligations, and with the advice of competent legal counsel.

### **MIRRORTOKEN TOKEN RELATIONSHIP**

I acknowledge that GTFO DAO LLC may issue MirrorToken tokens representing fractional interests in the delivery rights created by this commitment, and that such MirrorToken token holders shall have direct enforcement rights against me under this commitment.

### **NO GTFO DAO LLC OBLIGATION**

I acknowledge that GTFO DAO LLC has no obligation to me for payment or other consideration beyond providing the technical infrastructure for MirrorToken token issuance and management. My commitment is made directly to current and future MirrorToken token holders.
