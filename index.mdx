## 🧨 Billions Are Locked. GTFO Unlocks Them.

Early-stage token allocations are vesting for years — while the world trades around them.

Funds want to rebalance. Contributors want liquidity. Traders want access.\
Today, they get nothing — or go OTC, off-chain, and into legal gray zones.

**GTFO creates liquidity with clarity**:

- 📜 Legally binding delivery commitments from VCs
- 🧾 Native CLOB DEX — transparent, orderbook-based price discovery
- 🔄 Tradable ERC-20 forward contracts (MirrorTokens)
- 🔐 Onchain vault settlement, no intermediaries
- ⚖️ Commodity classification, not securities

## 🧬 MirrorTokens: Enforceable, Tradable, Final

Each MirrorToken is:

- A **fractional legal right** to a future token delivery
- Backed by a signed **Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)**
- **Enforceable in court** under commodity forward law
- **Settled automatically** by smart contracts, no admin keys

They’re **not derivatives, not securities, not synthetic exposure** — they’re the **real deal**, wrapped in ERC-20 and ready to trade.

## 📄 What Is a TDC?

A **Token Delivery Commitment** is a one-sided legal contract signed by the token issuer.\
It defines what gets delivered, when, and to which vault — no counterparties needed.

It turns locked allocations into something real, transferable, and enforceable.
