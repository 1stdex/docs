## What is GTFO?

**Legally-enforced secondary markets for locked token allocations.**

GTFO turns venture token allocations into tradeable forward contracts — with real legal rights, direct enforcement, and automated settlement.

## Why GTFO?

Billions in early-stage token allocations are locked behind vesting schedules, SAFT restrictions, and illiquid OTC deals.

GTFO introduces MirrorTokens — tokenized forward contracts backed by legal delivery commitments from VCs.

You get:

- ✅ Liquid secondary trading of vesting positions
- ✅ Direct legal rights to enforce token delivery
- ✅ Automated on-chain withdrawal with no intermediaries

## Protocol Overview

GTFO combines legal certainty with smart contract automation.

| Component        | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| MirrorTokens     | ERC-20 tokens that represent legal rights to future token delivery |
| TDC              | Token Delivery Commitment — a binding legal contract signed by VCs |
| Settlement Vault | Immutable smart contracts that receive and distribute tokens       |
| GTFO DAO LLC     | Marshall Islands legal entity deploying the infrastructure         |

## Not a Derivative. Not a Security.

MirrorTokens are not investments. They’re not SAFTs. They’re not synthetic.

They are **tokenized forward contracts** with **mandatory physical delivery** and **enforceable legal rights** under U.S. commodity law (CFTC jurisdiction).
