1st points are issued in defined periods called **seasons**. Each season has a fixed duration and a points multiplier that determines how many points are earned per dollar traded during that period.

Points are earned **only through trading activity**. Points are calculated based on the **USDC value of executed trades**, whether the trade is a buy or a sell. When selling mirror tokens, the USDC value received is used to calculate points in the same way as a buy order.

Points are **not** earned for liquidity provision or market making.

Seasons are sequential and time-based. As the platform matures, the multiplier decreases gradually until it stabilizes.

### **Season multipliers**

The points multiplier determines how many points are earned for the same amount of trading volume.

A higher multiplier means more points per dollar traded and is intended to reward early trading activity.

For example:

- During **Season 1 (3.0×)**, trading \$1,000 earns **3,000 points**
- During **Season 8 (1.0×)**, the same \$1,000 trade earns **1,000 points**

Once the multiplier reaches **1.0×**, points are earned at a stable rate of **1 point per \$1 traded**, regardless of trade direction.
