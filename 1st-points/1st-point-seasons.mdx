1st points are issued in defined periods called **seasons**. Each season has a fixed duration and a points multiplier that determines how many points are earned per dollar traded during that period.

Points are earned **only through trading activity**. Points are calculated based on the **USDC value of executed trades**, whether the trade is a buy or a sell. When selling mirror tokens, the USDC value received is used to calculate points in the same way as a buy order.

Points are **not** earned for liquidity provision or market making.

Seasons are sequential and time-based. As the platform matures, the multiplier decreases gradually until it stabilizes.

### **Season multipliers**

The points multiplier determines how many points are earned for the same amount of trading volume.

A higher multiplier means more points per dollar traded and is intended to reward early trading activity.

For example:

- During **Season 1 (3.0×)**, trading \$1,000 earns **3,000 points**
- During **Season 8 (1.0×)**, the same \$1,000 trade earns **1,000 points**

### **Season schedule**

| **Season** | **Period**                                         | **Multiplier** |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| 1          | Nov 3 – Nov 30, 2025                               | 3.0×           |
| 2          | Dec 1 – Dec 31, 2025                               | 2.5×           |
| 3          | Jan 1 – Jan 31, 2026                               | 2.0×           |
| 4          | Feb 1 – Feb 28, 2026                               | 1.8×           |
| 5          | Mar 1 – Mar 31, 2026                               | 1.6×           |
| 6          | Apr 1 – Apr 30, 2026                               | 1.4×           |
| 7          | May 1 – May 31, 2026                               | 1.2×           |
| 8+         | Jun 1, 2026 until conclusion of the points program | 1.0×           |

Once the multiplier reaches **1.0×**, points are earned at a stable rate of **1 point per \$1 traded**, regardless of trade direction.
