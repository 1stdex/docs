1st points are a non-transferable accounting system used to track user activity on the 1st platform.

Points are earned through participation on 1st, such as trading or engaging with features of the exchange. They are recorded off-chain and associated with a user’s account.

1st points do not represent tokens, ownership, or economic rights.

### **What points are used for**

1st points are used to measure and recognize usage of the platform over time.

They may be used in the future to:

- Determine eligibility for programs or incentives
- Inform access to features or experiments
- Reward early or active participants

The specific use of points may evolve, and earning points does not guarantee any future rewards.

### **What points are not**

- Points are not tokens
- Points are not transferable
- Points do not grant governance rights
- Points do not represent financial claims

Points currently exist solely as a usage-tracking mechanism within the 1st ecosystem.
