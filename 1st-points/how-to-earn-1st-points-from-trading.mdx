1st points are earned from executed and settled trades on the 1st DEX.

Points are awarded only when a trade is matched in the order book and settles successfully. Placing, modifying, or canceling orders does not earn points.

### **How points are calculated**

Points are calculated based on the USDC value of the executed trade, regardless of trade direction.

- **Buy orders** earn points based on the USDC spent
- **Sell orders** earn points based on the USDC received

Both sides of a trade earn points independently based on their own executed volume.

### **When points are credited**

Points are credited after the trade settles.

Unfilled orders, partially filled orders (for the unfilled portion), and canceled orders do not earn points.
