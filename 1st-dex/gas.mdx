All trading on 1st is gasless.

Users do not pay gas fees when placing, canceling, or filling orders on the exchange. There are also no gas fees for creating a wallet, depositing funds, or withdrawing funds.

### **How gasless trading works**

1st abstracts all onchain transaction costs away from the user.

Orders, trades, and settlements are executed without requiring users to sign or pay for individual blockchain transactions. Any underlying network costs are handled by 1st and are not passed on to users.

From a user perspective, trading on 1st feels instant and frictionless, without the need to manage gas or native tokens.

### **What users pay**

- No gas fees for trading
- No gas fees for deposits
- No gas fees for withdrawals

The only costs users incur are the transparent trading fees shown in the interface before execution.
