The 1st DEX is a decentralized exchange built specifically for trading mirror tokens.

It uses a central limit order book to enable continuous, two-sided trading of locked token allocations with deep liquidity, transparent pricing, and deterministic execution. Unlike AMMs, prices on 1st are set directly by supply and demand in the order book.

The exchange is designed to feel simple to use while preserving self-custody and on-chain settlement. Users can sign in, deposit funds, and trade immediately without connecting an external wallet or paying gas fees.

The 1st DEX is purpose-built for the private market. Its execution model, liquidity design, and settlement mechanics are optimized for assets that vest over time, rather than for spot-only trading.
