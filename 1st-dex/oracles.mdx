Oracles provide external price references used by the 1st DEX.

1st uses CoinGecko as a source of spot price data for underlying tokens. This data is used as a reference and for internal validations.

Trading prices on 1st are determined through the order book. Mirror token prices emerge from bids and asks placed by market participants and are not derived from oracle feeds.

Oracles do not participate in order matching or settlement. They exist to provide context and reference, not to control pricing.
