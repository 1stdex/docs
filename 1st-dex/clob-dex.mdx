The 1st DEX is a central limit order book (CLOB) decentralized exchange.

Trading on 1st happens through markets where mirror tokens are paired against USDC. Mirror tokens are onchain assets that represent upcoming token unlocks from private-market allocations. As vesting progresses, mirror tokens are burned and the underlying tokens are delivered to holders through drops.

Each listed market corresponds to a specific project and vesting schedule, and trades reflect exposure to future unlocks rather than spot supply.

### **Why a CLOB**

Mirror tokens require precise and transparent pricing.

Because mirror tokens represent time-based exposure to future token unlocks, pricing must reflect vesting risk, remaining time, and market demand. A CLOB allows traders to place explicit buy and sell orders at specific prices, enabling continuous price discovery through visible bids and asks.

This structure is better suited for vesting-based assets than AMMs, where prices are derived mechanically from pool balances rather than expressed directly by market participants.

### **What this enables on 1st**

Using a CLOB allows 1st to support:

- Transparent price discovery through visible bids and asks
- Deterministic execution based on price and time priority
- Deep liquidity across multiple price levels
- Professional market making alongside user orders

All participants interact with the same order book under the same rules.

### **Decentralized settlement**

Although trading uses a central limit order book, settlement happens on chain.

Users retain self-custody of their assets, trades settle deterministically through smart contracts, and ownership updates occur automatically. The CLOB defines how orders are matched, not who controls assets.
