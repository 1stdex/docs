1st runs entirely on smart contracts — no backdoors, no upgradability, no human intervention. Every delivery, claim, and vesting unlock is governed by math, not trust.

## 🧱 Core Contracts

### 🪞 MirrorToken

Every MirrorToken is more than an ERC-20. It’s a vault, vesting contract, and proportional claim engine rolled into one:

- ✅ ERC-20 token with exact fairness math
- ✅ Built-in checkpoint-based vesting logic
- ✅ Self-contained vault for real token settlement
- ✅ Claimable entitlements based on vesting schedule
- ✅ Fully non-upgradeable + EIP-2612 permit support

[→ See MirrorToken mechanics](./mirrortokens)

### 🌉 Cross-Chain Claiming with CCIP

1st supports **cross-chain delivery and claiming** via Chainlink CCIP.

- VCs can deliver tokens on Chain A
- Users can claim their share on Chain B
- No bridges. No wrapped IOUs. No trust assumptions.

MirrorTokens stay native. Claims stay trustless.

## 🧠 Design Principles

### 🔒 Immutability by Default

- All core contracts are deployed once, forever
- No proxy pattern, no upgrade risk
- Vaults are final — not upgradable, not pausable, not censorable

### 🧮 Math-Based Fairness

- No loops per user
- Vesting calculated at the exact checkpoint of each delivery
- All claim calculations use exact proportional math

### 🧪 Built for Security

- Formal audits before launch
- Zero backdoors
- Open source and verifiable
- Bug bounty via Immunefi

## 🔧 Dev-Ready Functions

Want to integrate with MirrorTokens?

Key view functions include:

- `getClaimable(address)` – amount claimable now
- `getAllocated(address)` – total allocations so far
- `getPendingAllocations(address)` – unprocessed checkpoint data
- `userCheckpoints(address)` – last user sync
- `totalDistributed()` – total real tokens delivered to vault

## TL;DR

1st isn’t just a frontend.\
It’s a full smart contract system — hardened, immutable, and designed to hold VC counterparties accountable through trustless delivery logic.
