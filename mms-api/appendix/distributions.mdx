- **Auto-claiming:** distributions **automatically claim** all owed base/quote proceeds on behalf of makers. You do not need to manually call `CLAIM` after a distribution.
- **Auto‑cancel:** only **sell orders that became under‑collateralized after a distribution** are **auto‑cancelled** during the distribution process.
- **Pause semantics:** During distributions, the market is **paused** and all orders that become undercollateralized after deflation will be automatically cancelled. Do not assume liveness during this window. Market makers should account for this downtime when calculating their uptime guarantees.
