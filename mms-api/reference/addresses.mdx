> **Note:** no deployments yet. Use placeholders while integrating. Replace these as soon as contracts are deployed.

## Core contracts

```ts
// Core protocol contracts
export const BOOK_MANAGER = '0xBookManager';
export const CONTROLLER = '0xController';
export const BOOK_VIEWER = '0xBookViewer';

// Providers for fee distribution
export const BUY_PROVIDER = '0xBuyProvider';
export const SELL_PROVIDER = '0xSellProvider';
```

## Tokens and vaults

### USDC (quote currency)

```ts
export const USDC = '0xUSDC';
export const VAULT_USDC = '0xVaultUSDC';
```

### MirrorTokens and their vaults

Each MirrorToken has a corresponding ClaimableDEXVault for trading:

```ts
// Example MirrorToken 1
export const MIRROR_TOKEN_1 = '0xMirrorToken1';
export const VAULT_MIRROR_TOKEN_1 = '0xVaultMirrorToken1';

// Example MirrorToken 2
export const MIRROR_TOKEN_2 = '0xMirrorToken2';
export const VAULT_MIRROR_TOKEN_2 = '0xVaultMirrorToken2';

// Add more as deployed...
```

## Networks

### Base Sepolia (testnet)

```ts
export const CHAIN_ID = 84532;
export const RPC_URL = 'https://sepolia.base.org';
```

Contract addresses on Base Sepolia will be published here once deployed.

## Looking up vault addresses

You can query vault addresses dynamically using the BookManager:

```ts
import { publicClient, BOOK_MANAGER } from './config';

// Get vault for any currency
const vaultAddress = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: BOOK_MANAGER,
  abi: bookManagerAbi,
  functionName: 'getVault',
  args: [currencyAddress], // Currency as address
});
```

## BookIds

BookIds are deterministically computed from a BookKey. Use the subgraph or BookManager to query active books:

```ts
// Query BookId from BookManager
const bookId = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: BOOK_MANAGER,
  abi: bookManagerAbi,
  functionName: 'getBookId',
  args: [bookKey],
});
```

See [Query subgraph](/mms-api/guides/query-subgraph) for how to fetch books and their IDs via GraphQL.
