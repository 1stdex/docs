description: 'Understanding provider addresses and when to use buy vs sell providers.'
---

## Overview

Every order (both maker and taker) must specify a **provider** address. The provider receives a portion of the trading fees, and you must choose the correct provider type—**buy provider** or **sell provider**—based on two factors:

1. **Which book you're trading in** (sell-base or sell-quote)
2. **Your role** (maker or taker)

## Provider selection

The correct provider to use depends on what **you** are doing in the trade:

- **Use buy provider** if you are **buying base currency**
- **Use sell provider** if you are **selling base currency**

## The two books

The system has two separate order books for each pair:

### Sell-base book

In this book, **makers sell base** and **takers buy base**:

- **Makers** (limit orders): Sell base, buy quote → use **sell provider**
- **Takers** (market orders): Buy base, sell quote → use **buy provider**

### Sell-quote book

In this book, **makers sell quote** (i.e., buy base) and **takers sell base**:

- **Makers** (limit orders): Buy base, sell quote → use **buy provider**
- **Takers** (market orders): Sell base, buy quote → use **sell provider**

## Examples

### Example 1: TKN/USDC sell-quote book

This is a book where makers want to buy TKN (base) with USDC (quote):

```solidity
// Alice places a limit order to BUY 1000 TKN at 2.0 USDC each
Controller.make(MakeOrderParams({
    id: sellQuoteBookId,
    tick: tick,
    quoteAmount: 2000e6,  // Offering 2000 USDC
    provider: buyProvider,  // ✅ Use BUY provider (buying TKN)
    referrer: address(0)
}));

// Bob executes a market order to SELL 1000 TKN
Controller.take(TakeOrderParams({
    id: sellQuoteBookId,
    tick: tick,
    baseAmount: 1000e18,  // Selling 1000 TKN
    provider: sellProvider,  // ✅ Use SELL provider (selling TKN)
    referrer: address(0)
}), deadline);
```

### Example 2: TKN/USDC sell-base book

This is a book where makers want to sell TKN (base) for USDC (quote):

```solidity
// Alice places a limit order to SELL 1000 TKN at 2.0 USDC each
Controller.make(MakeOrderParams({
    id: sellBaseBookId,
    tick: tick,
    baseAmount: 1000e18,  // Offering 1000 TKN
    provider: sellProvider,  // ✅ Use SELL provider (selling TKN)
    referrer: address(0)
}));

// Bob executes a market order to BUY 1000 TKN
Controller.take(TakeOrderParams({
    id: sellBaseBookId,
    tick: tick,
    quoteAmount: 2000e6,  // Offering 2000 USDC
    provider: buyProvider,  // ✅ Use BUY provider (buying TKN)
    referrer: address(0)
}), deadline);
```

## Quick reference

| Book       | Maker role | Maker provider | Taker role | Taker provider |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Sell-quote | Buy base   | Buy provider   | Sell base  | Sell provider  |
| Sell-base  | Sell base  | Sell provider  | Buy base   | Buy provider   |

## Getting provider addresses

Provider addresses are protocol-specific and can be found in the [addresses reference](/mms-api/reference/addresses).

## Referrers

The `referrer` parameter should be set to `address(0)` (zero address):

```solidity
referrer: address(0)  // or 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
