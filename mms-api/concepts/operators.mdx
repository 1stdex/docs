In the 1st DEX, orders are **owned by your address**. By default, **only you** can cancel or claim your orders.

## Controller approval required

The **Controller** needs operator approval to execute `CANCEL` and `CLAIM` actions on your behalf. This is a **one-time setup** per address.

Without operator approval:

- You can still **create** orders (MAKE, TAKE, LIMIT)
- You **cannot** cancel or claim via the Controller

## Enabling the Controller

Call `setOrderOperator` on BookManager:

```solidity
bookManager.setOrderOperator(CONTROLLER_ADDRESS, true);
```

This grants the Controller permission to:

- Cancel your open orders (releasing locked quote tokens back to you)
- Claim filled orders (settling base tokens to you)

The Controller **cannot**:

- Create new orders using your funds without your signature
- Withdraw your vault balances
- Transfer your tokens

## Checking approval status

```solidity
bool isApproved = bookManager.isOrderOperator(YOUR_ADDRESS, CONTROLLER_ADDRESS);
```

Returns `true` if the Controller is approved for your address.
