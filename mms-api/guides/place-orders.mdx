title: 'Place orders'
description: 'Post limit orders (MAKE) through the Controller.execute batching API.'
---

All trading actions are batched via `Controller.execute`. For each item in `actionList` you provide an **ABIâ€‘encoded** params struct in `paramsDataList`.

> **Providers:** Use the **buy provider** when you sell quote / buy base; use the **sell provider** when you sell base. Leave `referrer` empty.

## MAKE (post a limit)

The MAKE action allows you to post a limit order on the book at a specific tick (price level).

### MakeOrderParams struct

```
MakeOrderParams(
  id: uint192,
  tick: int24,
  quoteAmount: uint256,
  provider: address,
  referrer: address
)
```

### Example

```ts
const makeTypes = [
  { name: 'id', type: 'uint192' },
  { name: 'tick', type: 'int24' },
  { name: 'quoteAmount', type: 'uint256' },
  { name: 'provider', type: 'address' },
  { name: 'referrer', type: 'address' },
] as const;

const makeData = encodeAbiParameters(makeTypes, [
  bookId,
  tick,
  quoteAmount,
  provider,
  ZERO,
]);

await writeExecute([Action.MAKE], [makeData]);
```

### Parameters

- **id**: The book ID (uint192)
- **tick**: The tick (price level) where you want to place the order
- **quoteAmount**: The amount of quote tokens to place
- **provider**: The provider address for fee distribution (use buy provider when buying base)
- **referrer**: Referrer address (typically `address(0)` for market makers)
