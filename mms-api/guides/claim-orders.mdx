title: 'Claim orders'
description: 'Settle filled maker orders (CLAIM) through the Controller.execute batching API.'
---

All trading actions are batched via `Controller.execute`. For each item in `actionList` you provide an **ABIâ€‘encoded** params struct in `paramsDataList`.

## CLAIM (settle a filled maker)

The CLAIM action allows you to settle a filled (or partially filled) maker order and receive the base tokens from your trade.

When your limit order is matched, you need to claim it to:

- Receive the base tokens you bought (or release the base tokens you sold)
- Finalize the trade settlement
- Free up the order ID for reuse

### ClaimOrderParams struct

```
ClaimOrderParams(
  id: uint256
)
```

### Example

```ts
const claimTypes = [{ name: 'id', type: 'uint256' }] as const;

const claimData = encodeAbiParameters(claimTypes, [orderId]);
await writeExecute([Action.CLAIM], [claimData]);
```

### Parameters

- **id**: The order ID (uint256) of the filled maker order you want to claim

### When to claim

You should claim an order when:

- The order has been fully or partially filled
- You want to receive the traded base tokens in your vault
- You want to reuse the order ID for a new order

<Note>
  You can check the fill status of your orders by querying the subgraph. See the
  [Query subgraph guide](/mms-api/guides/query-subgraph) for more details.
