## Getting Started with Testing

The MMS API is deployed on testnet for testing and integration. For the chain ID, contract addresses, and subgraph URLs, please refer to the [Addresses & Networks](/mms-api/reference/addresses) page.

## Important Testing Information

### Contract Verification

All contracts have been verified in the block explorer to facilitate testing. You can easily inspect contract code, read contract state, and verify transaction details directly in the explorer.

### USDC (Mock Token)

USDC is a mock ERC20 token with a **public open mint function**. You can freely mint USDC tokens for testing purposes without any restrictions.

To mint USDC:

1. Navigate to the USDC contract in the explorer
2. Connect your wallet
3. Call the `mint` function with your address and desired amount

### Mirror Tokens

Mirror tokens work differently from USDC. **Mirror tokens need to be issued by 1st** and cannot be minted directly by users.

To obtain mirror tokens for testing:

- **Contact 1st** with your wallet address and the desired amount for each mirror token you need
- Mirror tokens will be issued to your specified address

### Listed Trading Pairs

By default, there are **5 listed pairs** available for testing, all starting with no trading activity.

<Note>
  Each pair has **2 books** - one for each side of the market. This means there
  are 10 books total across the 5 pairs.
</Note>

### Token Decimals and Pricing

<Warning>
  **Important:** Token decimals affect how ticks translate to real prices.
</Warning>

- **mRTKN6**: 6 decimals (same as typical USDC)
- **Other mirror tokens**: 18 decimals

When working with ticks and prices, remember that the decimal difference between base and quote tokens affects the price calculation. For more information on how ticks work, see the [Ticks concept page](/mms-api/concepts/ticks).
