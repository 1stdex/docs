Before you can place, cancel, or claim orders on the 1st DEX, you need to complete these one-time setup steps.

## 1. Obtain USDC

You need **USDC** (or other quote currency) in your wallet to:

- Post maker orders (quote is locked when you MAKE)
- Execute taker orders (quote is spent when you TAKE/SPEND)

Ensure you have sufficient USDC balance on the target network (Base Sepolia, etc.) before proceeding.

## 2. Obtain tokens to trade

Acquire the **base tokens** you want to trade:

- For buying: you'll receive base tokens when your quote orders fill
- For selling: you need base tokens in your wallet to sell

The 1st DEX trades **MirrorTokens** representing real-world assets. Check the available markets on your target network.

## 3. Approve tokens & deposit to vaults

**All trading happens from vault balances**, not directly from your wallet.

You must:

1. **Approve** the vault contract to spend your tokens
2. **Deposit** tokens into the vault for each currency you'll trade

The vault system allows gas-efficient order management without repeated token approvals.

→ See [Deposit & withdraw](/mms-api/guides/deposit-withdraw) for detailed instructions.
