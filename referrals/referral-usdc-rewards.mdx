Note: The referral system described below is not live yet. It is scheduled to go live in early January 2026.

Referral USDC rewards distribute a portion of trading fees when a referred user executes a buy trade on 1st.

USDC rewards apply **only to executed buy trades** and are calculated automatically at settlement.

### **How USDC rewards are distributed**

When a referred user executes a buy trade:

- A portion of the trading fee is paid to the referrer
- A portion of the trading fee is rebated to the referred user

Both rewards are settled instantly in USDC.

The distribution is as follows:

- The referrer receives **0.30%** of the USDC trade value
- The referred user receives a **0.15% USDC fee rebate**

These rewards are funded from the standard buy-side trading fee and do not increase the total fee paid to the market.

### **Example**

- A referred user buys \$10,000 worth of a mirror token
- The referrer receives \$30 USDC
- The referred user receives \$15 USDC back as a fee rebate

### **Important notes**

- USDC referral rewards apply only to buy trades
- Sell trades do not generate USDC referral rewards
- Rewards are credited only for executed and settled trades
- Unfilled or canceled orders do not generate rewards
