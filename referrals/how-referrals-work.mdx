Note: The referral system described below is not live yet. It is scheduled to go live in early January 2026.

Referrals on 1st reward users for introducing new traders to the platform.

When a referred user trades, a portion of the trading fees generated by that activity is shared between the referrer and the referred user. Referral rewards apply only to executed and settled trades.

To be eligible for referral rewards, the referrer must have completed at least \$100 in total trading volume on 1st. Trading volume can come from buys or sells. Once this threshold is met, referral rewards become active for that account.

Referrals are tied to a user account at signup and apply to future trading activity. There are no rewards for signups alone.

The specific mechanics of USDC rewards, point rewards, referral codes, and project referrals are described in the sections below.
