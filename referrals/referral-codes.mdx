_Note: The referral system described below is not live yet. It is scheduled to go live in early January 2026._

Referral codes are used to link a new user to an existing user for the purpose of referral rewards. Each eligible user on 1st can generate a unique referral code and share it with others. When a new user signs up using that code, the referral relationship is established.

### **How referral codes are applied**

Referral codes must be applied at the time of signup.

- A referral code cannot be added after an account is created
- Each account can be linked to only one referrer
- Once set, the referral relationship is permanent

### **Referral code activation**

Referral codes become active once the referrer has completed **at least \$100 in total trading volume** on 1st.

Trading volume can come from buys or sells. Once this threshold is met, the referral code becomes usable by new signups and referral rewards can begin accruing.

### **Important notes**

- Referral codes do not generate rewards on their own
- Rewards are earned only when referred users trade
- Self-referrals and circular referrals are not permitted

Referral codes exist solely to link accounts for reward calculation. They do not affect trading behavior or account permissions.
