_Note: The project referral system described below is not live yet. It is scheduled to go live later in 2026._

Project referrals reward users for introducing token projects to 1st.

A project referral applies when a referred project signs up to 1st and lists a market on the platform. Rewards are paid only after the project is onboarded and trading is live.

### **Project referral rewards**

If a project referral results in a successful signup and listing, the referrer receives:

- A one-time USDC payment of \$10,000
- 0.10% of the USDC value of all buy-side trades on the project’s listed markets

The buy-side fee share applies for the duration of the vesting schedule associated with the listed allocation.

### **How project referrals work**

- A user refers a project to 1st
- The project completes onboarding and lists a market
- Trading goes live
- Referral rewards begin accruing

Rewards are settled automatically in USDC.
