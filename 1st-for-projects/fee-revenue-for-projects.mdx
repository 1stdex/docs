Projects listed on 1st earn trading fee revenue from activity on their mirror token markets.

Fees are collected on every executed trade and distributed according to a predefined split. This allows projects to generate recurring revenue from private-market trading of their early allocations.

### **Fee structure for projects**

Projects earn fees on both buy and sell trades:

- On buy trades, projects earn 0.5% of the USDC trade value
- On sell trades, projects earn 0.5% of the token amount sold

Fees accrue continuously based on trading activity.

### **Fee payouts**

Project fees are paid out monthly, on the 1st of each month.

Fees earned during a given month are aggregated and settled in a single payout, rather than being distributed per trade. This simplifies accounting and reporting for projects.

### **Fee source**

Project fees are funded entirely from secondary trading activity on 1st.

This means:

- Projects do not pay to be listed
- Fees scale directly with market usage and demand
- Revenue is generated from speculation on Mirror tokens

As mirror tokens change hands throughout the vesting period, projects participate economically in private-market trading of their token.

### **Long-term revenue**

Because mirror tokens represent future unlocks, trading activity often continues throughout the vesting schedule.

This creates a recurring revenue stream for projects over time, rather than a one-time event tied to launch or fundraising. As liquidity and trading volume grow, project fee revenue grows alongside it.

### **Transparency and reporting**

All fee splits are defined upfront as part of the listing agreement.

Projects have full visibility into:

- Trading volume
- Accrued fees
- Monthly payouts

This ensures fee revenue is predictable, auditable, and aligned with the project’s broader token strategy.
