Before a project is listed on 1st, a listing agreement is executed between the project and 1st.

The listing agreement defines the scope, permissions, and economic terms of the listing. It ensures that trading of mirror tokens occurs with explicit project approval and under clearly defined conditions.

### **What the listing agreement covers**

The listing agreement specifies:

- Approval to trade mirror tokens representing the project’s locked allocations
- Confirmation of eligible allocation types and vesting schedules
- Fixed vesting terms that cannot be modified through trading
- Fee splits and revenue terms for the project
- Market structure and liquidity setup
- Details related to co-marketing
- Details related to listing timeline

### **Access to the full agreement**

The full listing agreement is shared directly with projects during the onboarding process.
