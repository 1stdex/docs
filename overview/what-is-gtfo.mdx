**GTFO is a decentralized protocol for trading locked token allocations.**

It creates liquid secondary markets for vesting positions using tokenized forward contracts ‚Äî called MirrorTokens ‚Äî that are legally enforceable and settled on-chain.

## Why it matters

Early-stage token allocations are often locked for years behind SAFTs and vesting cliffs. This creates massive friction for:

- üìâ VC funds that need to rebalance
- üí∏ Early contributors who want liquidity
- ü§ù Market makers seeking pre-TGE exposure

Today, these allocations are traded OTC with legal gray zones, zero transparency, and no enforceability.

GTFO changes that.

## How it works

GTFO introduces a new standard:

**MirrorTokens** ‚Äî tokenized **commodity forward contracts** that grant the holder a legally enforceable right to future token delivery.

Here's what makes it different:

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîê Legal Enforcement     | MirrorTokens are backed by signed Token Delivery Commitments from VCs ‚Äî legally binding forward contracts.  |
| üîÑ Onchain Settlement    | Tokens are delivered to smart contract vaults and distributed automatically based on MirrorToken ownership. |
| üìà Liquid Trading        | MirrorTokens can be traded freely on DEXs ‚Äî enabling price discovery for vesting allocations.               |
| ‚öñÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance | Operates under commodity forward law (CFTC), not securities regulation (SEC).                               |

## Who is GTFO for?

- **Venture Funds** with locked token allocations that want liquidity without triggering SAFT clauses or regulatory risk
- **Traders** seeking exposure to locked post-TGE allocations via enforceable, transparent markets
- **Projects**  who want to help VCs unlock capital without dumping their price

## What‚Äôs a MirrorToken?

MirrorTokens are ERC-20 tokens that represent **fractional rights** to future token delivery, backed by a signed, legally enforceable commitment from the original token holder.

They are **not derivatives**, **not investments**, and **not governed by the GTFO DAO**.

They are legally sound forward contracts with **mandatory physical settlement**.

## The Legal Backbone: TDCs

A TDC:

- Specifies the token, amounts, and delivery schedule
- Creates a **direct legal obligation**
- Requires physical delivery to the GTFO smart contract vault
- Can be enforced by **any MirrorToken holder**, directly

## TL;DR

GTFO creates a **legal, liquid, and trustless market** for locked token allocations.

You don‚Äôt need a new protocol to reinvent vesting.

You just need enforceable forward contracts, automated settlement, and open trading.
