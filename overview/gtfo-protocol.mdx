It enables secondary markets for vesting positions using MirrorTokens ‚Äî ERC-20 tokens backed by signed legal delivery commitments, settled onchain through vault-enabled smart contracts.

## üß± Core Components

1st is composed of four main components:

| Component                           | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)** | A one-sided, signed legal agreement from the token issuer, promising future delivery of specific tokens to a smart contract vault.        |
| **MirrorToken**                     | An ERC-20 forward contract representing proportional rights to the delivery in the TDC. Tradable, transferable, enforceable.              |
| **Settlement Vault**                | A smart contract that receives vested tokens from the issuer and automatically distributes them to MirrorToken holders.                   |
| **GTFO DAO LLC**                    | The infrastructure provider (a Marshall Islands DAO LLC) that deploys contracts, issues MirrorTokens, and publishes linked documentation. |

## üîÅ Lifecycle Flow

```

## üîê Smart Contract Design

1st smart contracts are:

- **Immutable** ‚Äì No upgrade paths, no admin keys
- **Vault-enabled ERC-20** ‚Äì Each MirrorToken contract includes logic to receive and distribute the underlying token
- **Permissionless** ‚Äì No whitelists, no middlemen
- **Algorithmic** ‚Äì Withdrawals and entitlements are calculated mathematically, not manually

Smart contracts use EIP-2612 (gasless approvals) and are optimized for gas efficiency.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Architecture

The legal layer is what makes 1st different from other ‚Äúwrapped vesting‚Äù ideas.

- MirrorTokens are **not derivatives**, **not investments**, and **not securities**
- The TDC is a **commodity forward contract**, enforceable under contract law
- MirrorToken holders have **direct legal rights** against the token issuer (not GTFO DAO, not an intermediary)
- Delivery is **physical (onchain)** ‚Äî not synthetic, not cash-settled

This qualifies 1st under **CFTC regulatory precedent**, not SEC jurisdiction.

## üîÑ Economic Dynamics

Each MirrorToken has a **fixed supply**, equal to the total tokens committed in its corresponding TDC.

Price reflects:

- Delivery probability
- Time to unlock
- Underlying token value
- Issuer credibility

There are no 1st fees. Traders may incur DEX fees and gas costs.

## üß† Minimal Governance

1st is built to run without discretionary intervention.

- No protocol admin keys
- No DAO voting over vault logic
- No delivery discretion ‚Äî the issuer is fully responsible
- No liquidity manipulation ‚Äî price discovery happens naturally

The GTFO DAO LLC exists only to deploy infrastructure and issue documentation. It does not participate in trading, pricing, or enforcement.

## üéØ Use Cases

1st unlocks a wide range of new behaviors:

| Use Case              | Example                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VC Liquidity**      | Sell part of your locked allocation without triggering security risk |
| **Contributor Exit**  | Access a portion of your vesting schedule for real-time liquidity    |
| **Market Pricing**    | Enable pre-TGE price discovery with real delivery enforcement        |
| **DeFi Integrations** | Use MirrorTokens in vaults, structured products, or AMMs             |

## TL;DR

1st is a protocol for turning locked token allocations into real, liquid, enforceable financial instruments.

- Legally sound
- Technically immutable
- Fully non-custodial
- Ready to trade
