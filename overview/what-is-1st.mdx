It enables compliant, enforceable, and onchain secondary markets for vesting positions through a new mechanism: **MirrorTokens** ‚Äî tokenized commodity forward contracts.

## üöß The Problem: Locked Allocations = Trapped Capital

In every cycle, billions in value sit idle in locked token allocations:

- VCs hold illiquid paper until vesting completes
- Contributors can‚Äôt rebalance or realize upside
- Traders can‚Äôt get exposure to early allocations
- OTC trades are manual, opaque, and legally risky

SAFTs and token grant agreements weren‚Äôt designed for liquidity ‚Äî and most trading of locked allocations today happens in legal gray zones.

> 1st turns this problem into an opportunity ‚Äî by reimagining how vesting rights are represented and exchanged.

## üß¨ The Solution: MirrorTokens

1st introduces **MirrorTokens** ‚Äî ERC-20 tokens that represent enforceable rights to future token delivery.

Each MirrorToken:

- Is backed by a **legally binding Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)**
- Is **physically settled** ‚Äî tokens must be delivered onchain
- Is **enforceable** directly by holders under commercial contract law
- Can be **traded freely** on any secondary market or DEX

MirrorTokens are **not derivatives, not securities, and not synthetic exposure**. They are tokenized forward contracts for actual delivery.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Designed for Legal Clarity

The foundation of 1st is the **Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)** ‚Äî a signed, one-sided agreement where the issuer commits to deliver tokens to a smart contract vault on a fixed schedule.

This structure:

- Creates a new legal asset: the **delivery right**
- Avoids investment contract status (Howey test)
- Qualifies as a **physically settled commodity forward contract** under U.S. CFTC precedent
- Establishes a **direct legal relationship** between issuer and MirrorToken holders

The protocol never takes custody. There are no intermediaries, no pooled investment schemes, and no discretionary managers.

## üîê How the Protocol Works

1. **A VC or token issuer signs a TDC**\
   Specifies the token, amount, delivery timeline, and settlement address.
2. **GTFO DAO deploys the MirrorToken contract**\
   An ERC-20 with vault logic. Immutable, permissionless, non-upgradeable.
3. **MirrorTokens are minted**\
   Issued to the signer, ready to be listed, transferred, or sold.
4. **Secondary trading begins**\
   Anyone can acquire forward rights via MirrorToken swaps.
5. **Tokens are delivered onchain**\
   At each unlock, the issuer sends tokens to the vault.
6. **Holders claim their share**\
   Based on proportional MirrorToken ownership, directly via smart contract.
