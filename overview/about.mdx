GTFO Protocol introduces a novel liquidity solution for locked token allocations through tokenized commodity forward contracts. The protocol enables secondary markets for vesting token positions by creating tradeable digital representations of physically-settled forward agreements.

## How It Works

When VCs and early investors have locked token allocations, they can create binding delivery commitments through GTFO. These commitments are tokenized as **MirrorTokens** - tradeable representations of the right to receive specific tokens on specific dates.

Unlike complex derivatives, GTFO uses straightforward commodity forward contracts with mandatory physical delivery. This creates genuine price discovery for vesting positions while maintaining regulatory clarity.

## What We Build

**GTFO DEX**\
Open-source, permissionless exchange for trading MirrorTokens. Protocol fees support the DAO treasury. MIT licensed.

**Infrastructure**

- Web interface at [gtfo.vc](http://gtfo.vc)
- Open-source subgraph for protocol data
- Smart contracts for commitment creation and settlement

**GTFO DAO LLC**\
A non-profit registered in the Marshall Islands that owns and manages all protocol assets not released under MIT license, maintains infrastructure, and governs treasury funds.

## Why It Matters

- **Unlock Liquidity**: Turn locked allocations into tradeable assets
- **Real Backing**: Every MirrorToken represents a legally binding delivery commitment
- **Open Ecosystem**: Trade on GTFO DEX or any compatible platform
- **Physical Settlement**: Actual token delivery, no synthetic exposure
