SAFTs, cliffs, vesting — they’re great for incentives.

But they’re a nightmare for liquidity, flexibility, and real-world trading.

## 🏗️ The Current System is Broken

Today, if you hold a locked token allocation — whether you're a VC, contributor, or early partner — you basically have 3 bad options:

1. **Wait 2–4 years** and hope the token’s still worth something
2. **Try to sell OTC**, manually, legally gray, painfully slow
3. **Borrow against it** with custodial, centralized risk

> None of these scale. None of them are transparent. And none of them unlock price discovery.

Meanwhile, real capital — billions of dollars — sits idle, unpriced, and untouchable.

## 💡 Why Doesn’t This Market Exist Already?

Because there hasn’t been a solution that is:

- ✅ Legally enforceable
- ✅ Onchain and automated
- ✅ Non-custodial and permissionless
- ✅ Transparent, transferable, and standardized

> You can’t build a market for locked tokens if the only instruments are spreadsheets and hope.

Until now.

| Secondary Trading               | ✅             | ✅     | ❌         |
| Fully Legal-Structured Forwards | ✅             | ❌     | ❌         |

## 🔓 1st Makes Vesting Liquid

1st introduces **MirrorTokens** — tokenized forward contracts that represent **real, enforceable rights** to future token delivery.

Each MirrorToken is backed by a **Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)** — a signed legal contract from the original token issuer.

This means:

- You can finally **trade vesting positions**
- VCs can **rebalance pre-unlock**
- Traders can **price allocations with conviction**

And it all happens **without custody, without bilateral agreements, and without legal ambiguity.**

## 🧠 This Is Bigger Than One Use Case

1st isn’t just a workaround.\
It’s a **structural protocol for an unpriced asset class**.

Token vesting markets are:

- Massive
- Friction-filled
- Growing every cycle
- Invisible onchain
- Ripe for price discovery, liquidity, and tooling

**1st brings this market into the light.**

## 🤯 Imagine This Future

- Any vesting position — turned into a liquid ERC-20 with delivery enforcement
- A token launch? Price the entire unlock curve months in advance
- Fund rebalancing? No need to wait for cliffs — just tokenize and trade
- DAO compensation? MirrorToken → DeFi composability

This isn’t just _possible_ — it’s already live.

## TL;DR

1st exists because:

- The market is broken
- The tools didn’t exist
- The risk was always too high

Now, with enforceable delivery contracts, vault-based settlement, and non-custodial infrastructure, we’re finally making vesting liquid — at scale, and onchain.
