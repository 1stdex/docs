Liquidity on trading pairs listed on 1st is provided through a combination of professional market makers and mirror tokens issued against imported private-market allocations. Each listed pair is designed to operate with continuous, two-sided liquidity from launch, rather than relying on sporadic order flow or passive listings.

Before a trading pair goes live, 1st onboards a professional market maker specifically for that market. The market maker provides buy-side liquidity using USDC and sell-side liquidity using mirror tokens that are backed by a SAFT or SAFE lent to the market maker for that purpose. \
\
Quoting behavior, minimum depth requirements, and uptime expectations are defined through market making agreements, ensuring consistent and predictable liquidity rather than best-effort participation. Market makers receive automatic fee rebates and do not accrue net trading costs when providing liquidity, allowing them to continuously support the order book without friction.

Additional sell-side liquidity comes from mirror tokens issued against imported private-market allocations. Early investors and VC funds can list any portion of their remaining vesting allocations at any time, adding real supply that reflects genuine selling intent.\
\
As more allocations are imported over time, sell-side liquidity increases organically, and listed pairs deepen as more private-market supply becomes tradeable.

A trading pair on 1st only goes live once two conditions are met:

- Market maker liquidity for the pair has been fully provisioned
- At least one verified allocation has been imported for that pair

This ensures that every listed market launches with both buy-side and sell-side depth, rather than thin or one-sided order books.

Over time, liquidity on each trading pair evolves through active market making, continued allocation imports, and the redeployment of liquidity-related fee reserves back into the same market. This structure allows liquidity to scale alongside trading activity while maintaining stable execution quality as markets mature.
