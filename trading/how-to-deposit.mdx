### **Important information**

**USDC on Base only**\
Only USDC sent on the Base network will appear in your 1st account. Tokens sent on other networks will remain in your wallet but won’t be detected by 1st.

**Fast detection**\
Most deposits appear within seconds after confirmation on Base. If a deposit hasn’t appeared after a few minutes, please join our Discord and open a support ticket.

**No fees or minimums**\
1st does not charge fees on deposits or withdrawals, and there is no minimum balance. We also cover gas fees for withdrawals and in-app transfers.

**Your smart wallet, your keys**\
This is your personal non-custodial smart wallet on Base. Only you control the keys. You can export your keys at any time from Settings, and withdraw USDC to any Base address whenever you like.

**Reuse this address**\
Your 1st wallet address never changes and can be reused for all future USDC-on-Base deposits.
