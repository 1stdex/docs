You can place limit buy or sell orders on any mirror token on 1st.

Limit orders let you set your preferred price when buying or selling. The order will only execute if the market reaches that price. Once filled, funds are automatically credited to your Assets page.

You can cancel an open limit order at any time before it is filled.
