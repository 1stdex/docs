1st uses a transparent fee model that aligns incentives between traders, projects, allocation holders, and liquidity providers.

All trading on 1st is gasless. Users do not pay gas fees when placing or filling orders. There are no fees for wallet creation, deposits, or withdrawals.

### **Buy orders (USDC)**

When a buy order is filled using USDC, fees are split as follows:

- 0.5% to referrals, if applicable
- 0.5% to the project
- 0.5% to VC funds with imported allocations, shared pro rata
- 1.5% to 1st

Fees are deducted automatically at execution and shown in the interface before confirmation.

### **Sell orders (tokens)**

When a sell order is filled using tokens, fees are split as follows:

- 0.5% to the project
- 1.5% reserved for market making liquidity
- 1.0% to 1st

The portion reserved for market making is used to support liquidity in the same trading pair.

### **Market maker fees**

Market makers receive automatic fee rebates and do not accrue net trading fees when providing liquidity. These rebates are not part of the standard fee splits.
