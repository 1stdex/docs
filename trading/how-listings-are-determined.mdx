Listings on 1st are created through a selective, permissioned process focused on market quality, liquidity, and long-term viability.

1st aims to list fundamentally strong, public projects with real products, active users, and demonstrated demand in the spot market. Listings are not created for speculative or unsupported assets.

### **How projects are selected**

Interest from traders on 1st plays an important role in determining which listings are pursued. User demand helps guide which projects are prioritized for outreach and evaluation.

For a listing to move forward:

- The project must approve trading on 1st
- Allocations must be verifiable and originate directly from the project
- Vesting terms and allocation conditions must be clear and fixed
- Sufficient liquidity must be prepared before trading begins

Only projects and allocations that meet these requirements are listed.

### **Quality control**

Listings are reviewed to ensure they represent real, tradeable supply with clear economics and reliable liquidity. This process helps protect users, projects, and the integrity of the market.

Not all projects or requests result in a listing.
