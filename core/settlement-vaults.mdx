The GTFO Settlement Vault isn’t a separate contract — it’s built **directly into the MirrorToken** itself. Every MirrorToken is more than just an ERC-20: it’s a **self-contained vault system** that handles distribution, proportional withdrawal, and secure onchain settlement, with **mathematical precision** and **zero admin privileges**.

### 🔁 Claiming is Native, Precise, and Gas-Optimized

Each MirrorToken uses a **checkpoint-based accounting model** to fairly and precisely track each holder’s share of delivered tokens. No loops. No burn. No waiting. When the VC delivers the underlying tokens per the vesting schedule:

- The MirrorToken vault updates on-chain entitlements
- Each holder can claim their exact proportion
- All math is deterministic, auditable, and enforced by the contract

> 🧮 MirrorToken = ERC-20 \+ Vault \+ Claim Logic

### 🔄 Cross-Chain Delivery with CCIP

We don’t just stop at one chain. With **Chainlink CCIP**, holders can:

- **Claim on other chains** (e.g. VC deposits tokens on Ethereum, you claim on Arbitrum)
- Avoid high gas environments or bridge risk
- Retain full delivery enforcement rights, regardless of destination chain

The result: a **cross-chain vault network** with **native composability and capital efficiency**.

### 🛡️ Trustless, Immutable, Non-Custodial

- MirrorTokens hold the real tokens — not 1st
- There are no admin keys or backdoors
- Delivery math is hard-coded and audited
- You don’t trust us. You trust math.

## TL;DR

MirrorToken vaults are **precision-engineered**, **autonomous**, and **cross-chain enabled**. They’re the final link between VC delivery and user redemption — and they work exactly as promised.
