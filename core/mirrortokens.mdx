They represent fractional claims to future token delivery, issued by token holders who have signed a Token Delivery Commitment (TDC).

MirrorTokens are fully transferable, non-custodial, and settled onchain.

## 🧠 What Does a MirrorToken Represent?

Each MirrorToken gives its holder:

- ✅ A **proportional right** to a fixed amount of tokens, scheduled for future delivery
- ✅ A **direct legal claim** under contract law (via the TDC)
- ✅ **Access to onchain redemption** once tokens are delivered to the smart contract
- ✅ The ability to **transfer or trade** those rights like any ERC-20 asset

They are **not synthetic**, **not pooled**, and **not tied to protocol governance**. They are one-to-one representations of a delivery obligation — like a tokenized IOU that is enforceable and automatable.

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standard**      | ERC-20 with EIP-2612 gasless approval                                        |
| **Supply**        | Fixed at issuance based on committed delivery quantity                       |
| **Transferable**  | Yes — tokens can be bought, sold, LP’d, or transferred freely                |
| **Settlement**    | Physical (on-chain) delivery only — no cash or synthetic settlement          |
| **Enforceable**   | Backed by a signed TDC, enforceable under commercial contract law            |
| **Non-custodial** | No protocol or DAO custody — tokens flow from issuer to smart contract vault |

## 🔐 How MirrorTokens Settle

1. **VC signs a Token Delivery Commitment (TDC)**\
   Legally binding promise to deliver tokens to a smart contract vault on a schedule.
2. **1st deploys the MirrorToken contract**\
   Vault-enabled ERC-20 contract with fixed supply and immutable logic.
3. **Issuer receives MirrorTokens**\
   These represent the full future obligation. The issuer can now sell or transfer them.
4. **Tokens are delivered over time**\
   The issuer sends tokens to the contract at each unlock milestone.
5. **Holders withdraw tokens**\
   Anyone holding MirrorTokens can redeem a proportional share of what’s been delivered.

## ⚖️ Why They’re Legally Sound

MirrorTokens are **not securities** or pooled investments.\
They are **commodity forward contracts** with physical settlement and no dependency on issuer performance.

Legally speaking:

- The value comes from **delivery of tokens**, not from any business or DAO activity
- The issuer has **no voting rights, no profit rights, no equity representation**
- Holders have **direct enforcement rights** against the signer of the TDC

## 📈 How MirrorTokens Are Valued

MirrorTokens are priced like real-world forward contracts:

> **Value = (Expected Spot Price × Delivery Probability) – Risk Premium**

Factors that affect pricing:

- ⏱️ Time until delivery
- 📉 Underlying token volatility
- 🧾 Issuer creditworthiness
- 📊 Liquidity in secondary markets
- ⚠️ Enforcement confidence

As delivery gets closer, uncertainty decreases — and the value of a MirrorToken converges toward the spot price of the underlying token.

## 🤝 What You Can Do with a MirrorToken

- 🛒 **Buy exposure** to locked tokens on secondary markets
- 💸 **Sell vesting rights** for liquidity — without custody or legal ambiguity
- 🧮 **Integrate** with vaults, AMMs, or structured products
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Enforce delivery** in court if the issuer fails to perform

MirrorTokens are designed to be **interoperable**, **enforceable**, and **simple to reason about**.

## 🧠 Frequently Asked

**Q: Is this like a wrapped SAFT?**\
No. MirrorTokens don’t represent the SAFT itself — they represent delivery rights created by a new legal contract (TDC). That’s what gives them clarity and enforceability.

**Q: Can MirrorTokens expire?**\
No. They are valid until all committed tokens are delivered. There’s no forced redemption or burn.

**Q: What happens if the VC doesn’t deliver?**\
MirrorToken holders have legal standing to enforce the TDC directly — including specific performance or damages.

**Q: Can MirrorTokens be used in DeFi?**\
Yes. They’re ERC-20 tokens and can be integrated into vaults, DEXs, lending markets, etc.
