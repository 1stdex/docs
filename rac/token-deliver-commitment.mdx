title: "Token Delivery Commitment Framework"
description: "Commodity Forward Structure for RAC Protocol"
---

## Overview

The RAC Forward Protocol operates through a streamlined commodity forward structure using Token Delivery Commitments (TDCs). This framework creates legally enforceable forward contracts while maintaining operational simplicity and regulatory compliance.

<Info>
  The Token Delivery Commitment is a commodity forward contract that requires mandatory physical delivery of digital tokens. This structure provides clear CFTC regulatory treatment while avoiding SEC securities classification.

## How It Works

### Basic Structure

mermaid

```
graph TD
    A[VC Fund] -->|Signs TDC| B[Legal Commitment]
    B -->|References| C[Smart Contract Address]
    D[GTFO DAO LLC] -->|Deploys| E[Smart Contract System]
    E -->|Mints| F[RAC Tokens]
    F -->|Represents| G[Forward Contract Rights]
    A -->|Delivers Tokens| C
    H[RAC Holders] -->|Withdraw| C
    B -->|Enforceable by| H
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **VC Signs Token Delivery Commitment**
   - Creates binding legal obligation to deliver specific tokens
   - Specifies delivery schedule, quantities, and smart contract address
   - No counterparty signature required - unilateral commitment
2. **GTFO DAO LLC Deploys Infrastructure**
   - Deploys immutable smart contracts for token settlement
   - Mints RAC tokens representing fractional forward positions
   - Publishes documentation linking RACs to TDC
3. **Market Trading Begins**
   - RAC tokens trade on decentralized exchanges
   - Each RAC represents proportional rights under the TDC
   - Market pricing reflects forward contract value and delivery expectations
4. **Physical Delivery Process**
   - VC delivers tokens directly to smart contract address per TDC schedule
   - Smart contract automatically updates available balances
   - RAC holders can withdraw proportional token amounts
5. **Enforcement Mechanism**
   - If VC fails to deliver, RAC holders can sue for specific performance
   - Direct legal relationship between VC and RAC holders
   - GTFO DAO LLC has no liability for delivery performance

## Legal Framework

### Commodity Forward Classification

<Tip>
  Token Delivery Commitments qualify as commodity forward contracts under CFTC regulations, providing clear regulatory treatment and avoiding SEC securities jurisdiction.
</Tip>

**Essential Elements Present:**

- **Physical Settlement Mandate**: Only actual token delivery satisfies commitment
- **Commodity Subject Matter**: Digital tokens established as commodities under law
- **Forward Contract Terms**: Future delivery at predetermined schedule and quantities
- **No Cash Settlement**: Cannot be satisfied with cash payments or offsets

### Regulatory Benefits

**CFTC Jurisdiction (Not SEC)**:

- Commodity forwards fall under CFTC authority, not SEC securities regulation
- Physical settlement provides exemptions from complex swap dealer rules
- Established legal framework with decades of precedent

**Securities Law Avoidance**:

- Forward contracts for commodity delivery are not securities
- No investment contract characteristics under Howey test
- Direct commodity delivery rights, not profit expectations from enterprise

### Enforceability Structure

**Direct Legal Relationships**:

- VC has binding delivery obligation under contract law
- RAC holders have direct enforcement rights against VC
- No intermediary dependencies or third-party performance requirements

**Specific Performance Available**:

- RAC holders can seek court orders requiring actual token delivery
- Monetary damages inadequate for commodity delivery failures
- Standard commodity forward remedies apply

## RAC Token Mechanics

### Token Rights and Characteristics

<Warning>
  RAC tokens represent fractional interests in the underlying Token Delivery Commitment. They are NOT utility tokens or investment securities, but rather tokenized positions in commodity forward contracts.
</Warning>

**Core Properties**:

- **Proportional Delivery Rights**: Each RAC represents fixed fraction of total delivery commitment
- **Direct Enforcement Rights**: RAC holders can legally enforce TDC against VC
- **Transferable Positions**: Forward contract rights can be traded on secondary markets
- **Physical Settlement Only**: Rights satisfied only through actual token delivery

**Not Included**:

- No voting rights in any protocol or organization
- No dividend, yield, or profit-sharing entitlements
- No management or governance participation
- No dependency on GTFO DAO LLC performance

### Settlement Mechanics

**Withdrawal Process**:

1. RAC holder calls withdrawal function on smart contract
2. Contract calculates proportional entitlement based on delivered tokens
3. Proportional token amount transferred automatically to holder
4. RAC remains valid - no burning required for withdrawal

**Proportional Distribution**:

- Available tokens distributed proportionally among all RAC holders
- If 100,000 tokens delivered and 1,000,000 RACs outstanding, each RAC can claim 0.1 tokens
- Withdrawal calculations performed automatically by smart contract
- No human intervention or discretionary allocation decisions

## Implementation Guide

### For Venture Capital Funds

**Pre-Signing Requirements**:

- Verify legal ownership of tokens subject to delivery commitment
- Confirm SAFT or allocation agreement permits transfer/delivery
- Obtain legal review of TDC terms and enforceability
- Ensure adequate capitalization for delivery obligations

**Execution Process**:

- Complete TDC template with specific terms and delivery schedule
- Execute document with proper corporate authorization
- Coordinate with GTFO DAO LLC for smart contract deployment
- Monitor delivery schedule and maintain token availability

<Info>
  VCs should treat TDCs as binding forward contracts with real delivery obligations. Failure to deliver exposes VCs to specific performance lawsuits and cover damages from RAC holders.
</Info>

**Ongoing Obligations**:

- Deliver tokens according to committed schedule
- Maintain clear title to tokens pending delivery
- Coordinate with smart contract system for delivery confirmation
- Respond to any enforcement actions promptly

### For RAC Token Holders

**Understanding Your Rights**:

- RAC tokens provide contractual rights to token delivery, not ownership of underlying business
- Rights enforceable directly against VC through legal system
- No dependency on GTFO DAO LLC for delivery performance
- Proportional sharing of delivered tokens with other RAC holders

**Risk Considerations**:

- **Delivery Risk**: VC may fail to deliver tokens as committed
- **Smart Contract Risk**: Technical bugs could affect withdrawal functionality
- **Market Risk**: RAC values may fluctuate based on delivery expectations and underlying token performance
- **Legal Risk**: Enforcement may require legal action against defaulting VCs

**Withdrawal Process**:

- Monitor smart contract for delivered token balances
- Call withdrawal functions when tokens become available
- Verify proportional entitlement calculations
- No time limits on withdrawal - tokens remain available until claimed

## Smart Contract Integration

## Risk Disclosures

### Primary Risks

<Warning>
  **Delivery Risk**: VCs may fail to deliver committed tokens according to schedule. This is the primary risk for RAC holders and must be evaluated based on each VC's creditworthiness and track record.
</Warning>

**VC Counterparty Risk**:

- VCs may become insolvent or unable to deliver tokens
- Legal enforcement may be time-consuming and expensive
- Recovery may be limited to VC assets and insurance coverage
- Due diligence on VC financial strength recommended

**Smart Contract Risk**:

- Technical bugs could affect withdrawal or distribution functionality
- Blockchain network issues may impact token delivery or withdrawal
- Smart contract immutability means bugs cannot be easily corrected
- Comprehensive auditing and testing mitigate but do not eliminate technical risks

**Market Risk**:

- RAC values may fluctuate based on underlying token performance and delivery expectations
- Secondary market liquidity may be limited for some RAC positions
- Time decay and delivery probability affect forward contract pricing
- No guarantee RAC values will correlate perfectly with underlying token values

### Regulatory Risk

**Classification Changes**:

- Regulatory interpretation of tokenized forwards may evolve
- Changes in commodity forward treatment could affect legal status
- International regulatory developments may impact cross-border trading
- Legal opinions reflect current law and interpretation

**Compliance Requirements**:

- Large RAC holders may face reporting or registration requirements
- Tax treatment of forward positions may be complex
- Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules may apply to large transactions
- Consult qualified legal and tax professionals for specific situations
