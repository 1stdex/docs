description: "Redeemable Access Credits for Liquid Token Allocation Markets"
---

## Abstract

RAC Forward Protocol introduces a novel liquidity solution for locked token allocations through tokenized commodity forward contracts. The protocol enables secondary markets for vesting token positions by creating tradeable digital representations of physically-settled forward agreements.

The system operates through Redeemable Access Credits (RACs) - tokenized commodity forward contracts that represent legally enforceable delivery obligations for underlying tokens. Each RAC represents a forward agreement where the seller (VC) commits to deliver specific tokens to an immutable vault, and the buyer (RAC holder) has the right to withdraw their proportional share. This structure provides the liquidity benefits of tokenization while maintaining the legal characteristics of commodity forwards under established regulatory frameworks.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Vision

RAC Forward Protocol addresses the fundamental liquidity challenge in early-stage token allocations by creating compliant secondary markets through physically-settled commodity forwards.

### 1.2 Key Innovation

The protocol's core innovation lies in tokenizing traditional commodity forward contracts:

- **RAC Token**: A tokenized representation of a commodity forward contract with physical settlement obligations
- **PFPA (Pre-delivery Forward Purchase Agreement)**: The underlying legal forward contract that each RAC represents

This structure enables liquid secondary trading of forward positions while preserving the physical settlement characteristics and legal framework of commodity forwards. The tokenization allows for fractional ownership, continuous trading, and automated settlement without changing the fundamental commodity forward nature of the underlying agreements.

### 1.3 Target Market

- Venture capital funds with locked token allocations
- Institutional investors seeking exposure to vesting positions
- Individual holders of SAFT agreements seeking liquidity
- Market makers providing liquidity services

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Illiquidity Challenge

Early-stage token allocations through SAFT agreements typically include multi-year vesting schedules, creating significant liquidity constraints for holders who may need to:

- Rebalance portfolios before vesting completion
- Meet redemption obligations to Limited Partners
- Realize gains for reinvestment opportunities
- Manage risk exposure over extended time horizons

### 2.2 Existing Solutions Limitations

Current approaches to address allocation illiquidity face significant challenges:

**Traditional Assignment**: Direct SAFT transfers often require project approval and may be restricted or prohibited entirely.

**Derivative Instruments**: Synthetic exposure through swaps or options creates regulatory complexity under CFTC derivatives rules and may not provide actual token delivery.

**Lending/Borrowing**: Using locked allocations as collateral creates additional counterparty risk without providing true liquidity.

### 2.3 Regulatory Complexity

Existing liquidity solutions often trigger securities regulations (SEC) or derivatives regulations (CFTC), creating compliance burdens that limit their practical deployment.

## 7. Smart Contract System

### 7.1 Architecture Overview

The protocol employs an immutable smart contract design prioritizing direct holder access and eliminating third-party management:

**RAC Token Contract**

- Standard ERC-20 implementation with EIP-2612 gasless approval support
- Fixed supply with no minting, burning, or administrative functions
- Embedded vault address providing direct technical access utility
- Immutable upon deployment with no upgrade or modification capabilities

**Immutable Vault Contract**

- Self-executing contract with predetermined algorithmic withdrawal logic
- No administrative functions, owner keys, or upgrade mechanisms
- Direct function calls from RAC holders trigger proportional withdrawals
- Mathematical precision ensured through checkpoint-based calculations built into contract code

### 7.2 Security Design Principles

**Complete Immutability**: Vault contract cannot be modified, upgraded, paused, or controlled by any party after deployment

**Direct Access Model**: RAC holders interact directly with vault contract without intermediaries

**Algorithmic Execution**: All withdrawal calculations performed by predetermined mathematical formulas in contract code

**Zero Administrative Control**: No owner keys, admin functions, or discretionary powers in deployed contracts

**Transparency**: All source code publicly verifiable and audited before deployment

### 7.3 Vault Withdrawal Mechanics

**Token Deposit Process**:

1. VC transfers vested tokens directly to vault contract address
2. Vault automatically updates available balance using internal accounting
3. Checkpoint system records deposit for proportional calculation purposes
4. No human intervention or management decisions required

**Direct Withdrawal Process**:

1. RAC holder calls withdrawal function directly on vault contract
2. Contract calculates proportional entitlement using algorithmic formulas
3. Underlying tokens transferred automatically to holder's address
4. Vault updates internal accounting and emits transaction events

**Balance Verification**:

- Real-time vault balance queries through standard contract functions
- Proportional entitlement calculations verifiable through contract calls
- All historical transactions permanently recorded on blockchain
- Independent verification possible without relying on third parties

## 8. Economic Model

### 8.1 Commodity Forward Pricing

RAC value reflects standard commodity forward pricing dynamics:

**Forward Price = Spot Price × e^(r×T) ± Basis**

Where:

- **Spot Price**: Current market value of underlying tokens
- **r**: Risk-free rate
- **T**: Time to delivery
- **Basis**: Premium/discount for delivery convenience, storage costs, and delivery risk

**Market Value Drivers:**

- **Underlying Token Performance**: Direct correlation with spot price movements
- **Delivery Timeline**: Time value and convenience yield considerations
- **Counterparty Risk**: VC delivery probability and enforcement mechanisms
- **Liquidity Premium**: Secondary market depth and trading efficiency

### 8.2 Forward Market Dynamics

**Supply Factors:**

- Fixed RAC supply equals total commodity units under forward contract
- No additional token issuance or supply changes possible
- Settlement activity does not affect outstanding token supply

**Demand Factors:**

- Underlying commodity (token) price expectations and volatility
- Forward delivery schedule and completion probability assessments
- Alternative investment opportunities and opportunity costs
- Secondary market liquidity and transaction costs
- Regulatory certainty and enforceability of forward contracts

**Price Discovery Mechanisms:**

- Continuous secondary market trading on decentralized exchanges
- Arbitrage between forward prices and underlying commodity spot prices
- Risk premium adjustments for delivery and counterparty risks
- Time decay as delivery dates approach

### 8.3 Settlement Economics

**Physical Delivery Value:**

- Settlement value equals delivered commodity tokens, not cash equivalent
- No mark-to-market cash flows or variation margin requirements
- Final settlement occurs through physical transfer of underlying tokens
- Forward contracts fulfilled regardless of price movements during contract term

### 8.3 Fee Structure

**Protocol Fees**: None - RAC Forward Protocol operates without protocol fees

**Transaction Costs**: Standard blockchain gas fees for smart contract interactions

**Third-Party Costs**: DEX trading fees and potential OTC market spreads

## 9. Regulatory Framework

### 9.1 Commodity Forward Classification

RAC Forward Protocol operates within established commodity forward regulatory frameworks:

**CFTC Jurisdiction (United States)**

- RACs represent tokenized commodity forward contracts under CFTC authority
- Physical settlement requirement satisfied through actual token delivery to vault
- Forward contracts for digital commodities exempt from swap dealer regulations when physically settled
- End users (RAC holders) face minimal regulatory requirements as commodity forward buyers

**Commodity Forward Exclusion**

- Physical settlement intent and capability maintained throughout contract lifecycle
- No cash settlement option available - only delivery of underlying commodity tokens
- Forward pricing and delivery terms predetermined, not marked-to-market
- Consistent with CFTC precedent for physically-settled commodity forwards

### 9.2 Securities Law Analysis

RACs avoid securities classification as commodity forward contracts:

**Investment Contract Analysis (Howey Test)**:

- **Investment of Money**: ✓ RAC purchases involve monetary investment
- **Common Enterprise**: ✗ Individual forward contracts, not pooled investment scheme
- **Expectation of Profits**: ✗ Commodity delivery rights, not profit from enterprise activities
- **From Efforts of Others**: ✗ Value derives from commodity delivery, not managerial efforts

**Commodity vs. Security Classification**:

- Digital tokens established as commodities in US regulatory precedent
- Forward contracts for commodity delivery are not securities
- Physical settlement distinguishes from cash-settled financial derivatives
- No profit-sharing or equity-like characteristics in forward structure

### 9.3 CFTC Registration Considerations

**Commodity Pool Operator (CPO) Analysis:**

- GTFO DAO LLC issues individual forward contracts, not pooled investment vehicles
- No profit/loss sharing among RAC holders - each holds individual forward rights
- No discretionary trading or commodity speculation on behalf of investors
- Physical delivery focus distinguishes from managed commodity pools

**Potential Registration Requirements:**

- CPO registration may be required depending on final structure and legal interpretation
- Registration provides clear regulatory pathway and operational certainty
- Compliance costs manageable within standard commodity industry practices

### 9.4 International Regulatory Considerations

**European Union (MiCAR)**

- RACs likely classified as Asset-Referenced Tokens under MiCA framework
- Traditional commodity forwards may be exempt, but tokenization creates uncertainty
- Regulatory authorization and compliance requirements if offering to EU residents
- Consider restricting EU access pending regulatory clarity

**Other Jurisdictions**

- Commodity forward treatment generally recognized internationally
- Physical settlement requirement supportive of non-derivatives classification
- Local commodity regulations may apply depending on jurisdiction and offering scope

### 9.4 International Considerations

**European Union (MiCAR)**

- RACs qualify as utility tokens under Article 4(3)(c)
- No authorization requirements for utility token issuance
- Standard consumer protection and market abuse rules apply

**Other Jurisdictions**

- Framework adaptable to local commodity forward regulations
- Physical settlement requirement universally supportive of non-derivatives treatment
