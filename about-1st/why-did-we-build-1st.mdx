1st was built to fix a structural problem in how token markets function after a project launches.

Today, most tokens enter the market with low circulating supply and large amounts of locked private-market allocations. These allocations are invisible to the market, even though they represent future sell pressure.

This creates a disconnect between how tokens are priced and how supply actually behaves over time.

### **The problem with post-TGE markets**

After a token launches:

- Early investors hold large allocations at low cost bases
- Most of those tokens are locked under vesting schedules
- Public markets trade a small circulating supply at high valuations
- Unlock events release large amounts of supply all at once

\
When unlocks happen, sell pressure appears suddenly and predictably. This often leads to sharp price declines that affect retail investors, projects, and long-term market confidence. \
\
The problem is not that early investors want liquidity. The problem is that there is no structured way to express that liquidity before unlocks.\
\
**Why existing solutions do not work**

Before 1st, early liquidity options were limited:

- Manual OTC deals that were slow, opaque, and accessible only to insiders
- Large minimum ticket sizes that excluded most participants
- No continuous price discovery
- No way for projects or markets to see how private supply was being valued

These transfers happened off-market and out of view, while public markets remained disconnected from private-market reality.

### **What was missing**

What the market lacked was a way to:

- Reduce sudden sell pressure on public exchanges
- Trade locked allocations during vesting with deep liquidity
- True price discovery of private market assets
- Allow both early investors and new buyers to participate at fair market prices

In other words, the market needed a liquid private market that operated alongside public trading, not after it.

### **Why 1st exists**

1st was built to introduce that missing layer.

By turning locked allocations into mirror tokens and enabling them to trade with deep liquidity, 1st allows private-market risk to be priced continuously and transparently.

This shifts market dynamics in three important ways:

- Liquidity moves from unlock events to ongoing markets
- Price discovery happens earlier and more gradually
- Public markets face less sudden supply shocks

1st does not change token supply or vesting terms. It changes when and how that supply is priced.
