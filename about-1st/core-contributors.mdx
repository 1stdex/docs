**1st is built and maintained by the team that pioneered vesting-market trading of locked token allocations and operated it at scale in production.**

The core contributors previously built and operated production infrastructure for managing token allocations, vesting schedules, and secondary trading of locked tokens through Spring (prev. Presail). Through this work, they supported hundreds of projects, facilitated more than \$400 million in capital raised by users of their infrastructure, and settled over 22,000 real trades of locked token allocations.

This experience directly informed the design of 1st. The system is built by contributors who have already run the market it is designed to scale, rather than experimenting with unproven models.

The core contributors to 1st are:

- Sebastian Almnes
- Milad Mirshahi
- Xurxo Mendez Perez
- August Haug Hem
- Håkon Mælumsæter Øverby

This team is responsible for the design, development, operations, and ongoing maintenance of 1st.
