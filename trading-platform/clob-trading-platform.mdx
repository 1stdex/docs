This isn’t a pool. It’s not a bonding curve. It’s not another copy-paste AMM.

It’s a **true marketplace for token vesting rights** — built for price discovery, capital efficiency, and scale.

## 🚀 Seamless Onboarding, Non-Custodial by Default

**Trading on GTFO feels like Web2 — but it's powered by bleeding-edge crypto.**

You don’t need to worry about wallets, seed phrases, or gas fees.\
Just sign up with **Gmail**, and you’re ready to trade.

> Under the hood, you’re using:
>
> - 🔐 **MPC smart wallets** (non-custodial, owned by you)
> - 🧠 **Smart contract accounts** (fully programmable and upgradable)
> - 🛠️ **Gasless UX** (we sponsor your gas fees)
> - 💸 **Fiat on-ramps and off-ramps** built-in

### ✅ What you get:

- Sign up in seconds — with no crypto knowledge required
- Hold MirrorTokens in your own self-custodied wallet
- Trade instantly without switching chains or juggling gas
- Deposit USDC from a card, bank, or crypto wallet
- Redeem real tokens post-vesting — always in your control

**We’re not a custodian.**\
We never touch your funds, can’t move your assets, and don’t issue wrapped IOUs.

GTFO is the UX you want, with the decentralization you need.

## 🔄 What Makes GTFO Different

Most DeFi protocols rely on AMMs — which work for spot swaps, but break down in fragmented, low-float, asymmetric markets like token vesting.

GTFO uses a fully on-chain **CLOB** to power MirrorToken trading. That means:

- 🧾 **Transparent orderbooks** — all bids and asks are visible, filterable, and queryable
- 🎯 **Efficient price discovery** — orders match at the best price, no slippage roulette
- ⚡ **Deep liquidity at thinner depth** — no need to rely on huge pools or toxic LP flow
- 🧠 **Advanced strategy support** — market makers, funds, and traders can operate natively

> MirrorTokens aren’t farm tokens. They’re financial instruments — and they deserve a financial market.

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Issuers mint MirrorTokens** backed by a Token Delivery Commitment
2. **MirrorTokens are listed on GTFO’s CLOB** with custom tickers (e.g. `$mToken`)
3. **Anyone can place limit or market orders** — fully on-chain
4. **Traders match orders directly** through the protocol UI or integrated tools
5. **Ownership updates instantly** — and settlement happens post-delivery via the vault

## 🧠 Why We Chose a CLOB

**Because real markets don’t run on curve math.**\
They run on buyers, sellers, orderbooks, and execution.

| Feature              | AMM                   | GTFO CLOB               |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Price Discovery      | Implicit, curve-based | ✅ Explicit, order-based |
| Liquidity Efficiency | Requires large pools  | ✅ Thin books still work |
| Trade Strategy       | Manual swaps          | ✅ Precision trading     |
| Slippage             | Constant risk         | ✅ Transparent spreads   |

## 🛠️ Built for Traders

Whether you’re a fund, whale, sniper, or algo:

- **Limit \+ market orders supported**
- **Native on-chain matching**
- **Filter by ticker, unlock date, or project**
- **Pre-TGE exposure, fully tradable**
- **Composability with your own bots or UI** (soon)

> This isn’t swap-and-pray. This is a forward contract market with price, structure, and edge.

## 🧾 Example Trade Flow

**Alice wants early exposure to \$FOO’s token, vesting in Q4.**

1. She finds `$MIRR_FOO_DEC24` listed on GTFO’s CLOB
2. She places a limit order to buy 10,000 MirrorTokens at \$0.62
3. A VC sells into her bid
4. Alice now holds enforceable rights to 10,000 real \$FOO tokens — claimable on-chain post-vesting

## 💰 Fees

- **Protocol fees**: None — GTFO doesn’t extract protocol-level fees
- **Trading fees**: Maker/taker fees apply per market (see UI or docs)
- **Settlement gas**: Standard onchain vault claim cost

## 💬 Frequently Asked

**Q: Can I market buy MirrorTokens?**\
Yes. Market and limit orders are both supported on GTFO’s CLOB.

**Q: What happens when the tokens unlock?**\
Your MirrorTokens entitle you to a proportional claim. Redeem them on-chain through the vault contract.

**Q: Can I cancel orders?**\
Yes — orders are cancellable as long as they haven’t been matched.

**Q: Do I need to trust GTFO DAO for execution?**\
No. Matching, fulfillment, and redemption are fully non-custodial and smart contract enforced.

## TL;DR

GTFO isn’t a swapper.\
It’s the **first real trading venue** for locked token allocations — powered by a native onchain orderbook.
